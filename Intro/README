Changing the lighting conditions really changed the ability to track the
object. Obviously with the lights off it did not track, but even with the phone
light it was not able to track likely because the shinyness made the object
seem like a different color with the phone light.

It was tought to track the color picker on my phone. If the brightness was all
the way down, the color would not show at all. If the brightness was all the
way it, it was too shiny and reflective to track.

4.4
The phone color picker is definitely more robust to brightness than the object.
It was tough for the tracker to pick up the exact proper color of either.
